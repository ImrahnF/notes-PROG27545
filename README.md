# Springbok Application and Notes
This repository serves as a learning resource for me to enhance my comprehension of the course `PROG27545 Web Application Design & Implementation`, which covers approximately weeks 1-7 (inclusive).

The repository contains a Springboot application that attempts to implement the concepts learned in class. It provides explanations along the way and includes examples that refer to the project for a better understanding. 

## Annotations:
- `@Controller`
  - This annotation tells Spring that the class will handle **HTTP Requests**. It is responsible for returning views, such as html files (index.html). It is marked as a **controller** in the ***Model-View Controller (MVC)*** Architecture.
  - Controllers are responsible for taking user inputs and processing it using the model and then returning a view (HTML pages).

- `@GetMapping("/")`
  - This annotation is used to handle **HTTP GET** requests. In this case, it will run the moethod when it is at the default/base url `localhost:8080/`. 
  - Often used for fetching data or rendering HTML views/pages.
  - At the end of the method under the `GetMapping("/")`, it runs `return "index"` which tells the view to load the `index.html` page,

- `PostMapping("/add")`
  - This annotation is used to handle **HTTP POST** requests, often done through submitting data to the server (such as a form submission). In this case, it can be imagined as filling out a task form and submitting it to the server to add it.
  - The `/add` URL is specified in an HTML form's `action` attribute and specifies that it is a `POST` request. *Below is an HTML form*:
  ```html
  <form action="/add" method="POST">
  ``` 
  - The method under the mapping also returns the `"redirect:/"` which simply redirects the user back to the main page to display the updated list.

These annotations are implemented in the 
`TaskController.java` file [here](https://github.com/ImrahnF/todo-list-notes-PROG27545/blob/main/src/TodoListApplication/src/main/java/sheridan/omrahn/todolistapplication/controller/TaskController.java).

## Return Statements in Annotations
Under `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping`, there are methods that eventually return something. 
### `return "index"`
```java
@GetMapping("/")
public String showTasks(...)
  // ... 
  return "index"; 
}
```
This is used to specify which view/template (in this case, an HTML file) to render when the method under `GetMapping("/")` is called. Since this line runs when the user is at the base/default URL, it returns `"index"` which corresponds to the `"index.html"` file in the `templates/` folder.

What this basically means in terms of **this project** is that when the user is at the URL `localhost:8080/`, it runs the `showTasks()` method that eventually returns `"index"` to load/render the `index.html` page.


### `return "redirect:/"`
```java
@PostMapping("/add")
public String addTask(...)
  // ... 
  return "redirect:/"; 
}
```
Although similar to the previous return statement, this tells Spring to **redirect** instead of rendering a page. In this case, it redirects to the default URL. After the redirect, it will then be handled by the previous method under `@GetMapping("/")`.

These return statements are implemented in the 
`TaskController.java` file [here](https://github.com/ImrahnF/todo-list-notes-PROG27545/blob/main/src/TodoListApplication/src/main/java/sheridan/omrahn/todolistapplication/controller/TaskController.java).

## HTTP Sessions & Models
**HTTP Sessions** is a way to store data across several HTTP requests coming from the same user. This is temporary "storage" that last for the user's session on the website. It is useful for tracking things such as authentication statuses, shopping carts, etc. However, in this case, it is used to track our **To-do list**.

### How is Data Sent Through Sessions?
The data we are working with is sent through sessions using the `HttpSession` interface, allowing us to *store* and *retrieve* data tied to a session. 

**Adding** attributes to a session is done through `session.addAttribute("key", value)` and retrieving is done through `session.getAttribute("key")` where:
- `"key"` refers to the attribute **name**
- `value` refers to the **value** of the attribute.

An **example:**
```java
// Save list of student names (Strings) to session
session.setAttribute("Students", studentList);
// Retrieve students from session
List<String> updatedStudentList = (List<String>) session.getAttribute("Students");
```
This example shows us setting a list of student strings (`studentList`) to the `"Students"` attribute in the session which. It then creates a new `updatedStudentsList` list and populates it with what we just populated the `Students` attribute with.

### How is this different from models?
The difference between a **Session** and **Model** is the fact that a **Model** is used for temporary data that is passed from the controller to a view (i.e. a web page) that will *only* be used to display data.

A **Session**, as mentioned, is used to store data that needs to persist across several HTTP requests during the user's session on the website. 

**Conclusion:** While models are usually for temporary data (one-time requests), sessions are used to store data across the entire user's interaction with the app. The session data can be updated and accessed at any point during the userâ€™s session.

## HTTP Request Types

## GET and POST on Same URL?
